/net/tscratch/people/plgjuliaryb/venvs/comp-lingu/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/utils/data/dataloader.py:617: UserWarning: This DataLoader will create 8 worker processes in total. Our suggested max number of worker in current system is 4, which is smaller than what this DataLoader is going to create. Please be aware that excessive worker creation might get DataLoader running slow or even freeze, lower the worker number to avoid potential slowness/freeze if necessary.

torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 10.25 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 39.67 GiB of which 1.06 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 38.60 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 26.69 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 11.41 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
