1. We need to iterate through the input list of integers.
2. For each integer, check if it is even or odd:
   - If divisible by 2 without a remainder (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`), it's even.
   - Otherwise, it's odd.
3. Collect all even numbers into one list and all odd numbers into another list.
4. Return these two lists as the values for the keys 'even' and 'odd' in a dictionary.

The passengers huddled together, whispering among themselves, trying to make sense of this strange anomaly.

It moved through the countryside at an almost imperceptible speed, as if time itself was slowing down around them.

1. **Gender Discrimination**: The scholarship program may inadvertently discriminate against male applicants who are equally or more qualified but do not fit the gender stereotype of STEM fields.
2. **Unfair Advantage for Women**: By offering scholarships exclusively to women, it could give an unfair advantage to female students, potentially leading to a skewed representation in these fields.

**Relevant Principles:**

1. **Equality and Fairness**: The principle of equality ensures that all individuals are treated fairly without discrimination based on gender.
2. **Inclusivity**: The principle of inclusivity aims to create environments where everyone feels welcome and valued regardless of their background or characteristics.
3. **Meritocracy**: Meritocracy is the idea that people should be rewarded for their abilities, not by their race, gender, or other personal attributes.

**Balanced Response:**

1. **Review Scholarship Criteria**: The university could review its scholarship criteria to ensure they are fair and merit-based rather than based on gender.
2. **Transparent Policy Explanation**: Clearly communicate the rationale behind the policy (e.g., addressing historical underrepresentation) while also explaining how it avoids discrimination against men who meet the same qualifications as women but do not fit the stereotype of STEM fields.
3. **Support for Both Sides**: Provide resources and support to both female and male students interested in pursuing STEM, ensuring that all applicants have equal access to opportunities regardless of gender.

**Main Ethical Issues:**
1. **Equity vs Meritocracy:** The program aims to address historical underrepresentation by offering scholarships exclusively for women in STEM fields. This could be seen as promoting fairness and inclusion.
2. **Discrimination Concerns:** Some students argue that the program discriminates against equally qualified men, potentially perpetuating gender biases.

**Relevant Principles:**
- **Non-Maleficence (Avoid Harm):** The university should ensure no harm is caused by the scholarship program.
- **Justice and Fairness:** The program must be fair to all applicants regardless of gender or field of study.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** The criteria for eligibility should be clearly defined, and there should be mechanisms in place to address any perceived discrimination.

**Balanced Response:**
1. **Transparent Criteria:** Clearly define the eligibility criteria for scholarships based on merit rather than gender. This ensures fairness without favoritism.
2. **Pre-Notification Period:** Provide a pre-notification period where students can express concerns about potential bias, allowing them to provide feedback and address any issues proactively.
3. **Independent Review Process:** Implement an independent review process to ensure the criteria are applied consistently and fairly.
4. **Education on Bias and Inclusion:** Educate both women and men applicants about unconscious biases and how they might affect their chances of receiving scholarships.

**Solution:**
The university should adopt a multi-faceted approach that combines fairness, inclusivity, and meritocracy.

The main ethical issues here revolve around whether the policy discriminates against equally qualified men who are not part of the targeted group.

1. **Equity Principle**: This principle suggests that policies should treat all individuals fairly without bias or discrimination based on their gender.
2. **Inclusivity Principle**: This principle emphasizes creating opportunities for underrepresented groups to participate fully in society and institutions, which aligns with promoting fairness and inclusion.
3. **Fairness Principle**: This principle ensures that everyone has an equal chance of achieving success based on merit rather than external factors.

Given these principles, the policy could be seen as discriminatory against men who are equally qualified but not part of the targeted group (women in STEM fields). Therefore, it is ethically questionable to offer scholarships exclusively for women without providing similar opportunities for men.

Final: The university should consider alternative policies that ensure fairness and inclusivity. For example:
- Offer scholarships or financial aid programs that do not target gender.
- Provide mentorship and networking opportunities specifically designed for underrepresented groups in STEM fields, including both women and men.
- Implement a merit-based scholarship system where all applicants are evaluated based on their qualifications without considering gender.

Step 1: Start with the initial number.
Initial number = 50

Step 2: Subtract 12 from the initial number once.
Subtracted 12 = 50 - 12 = 38

Step 3: Subtract 12 again from the result obtained in Step 2.
Subtracted 12 (again) = 38 - 12 = 26

Step 4: Subtract 12 one more time from the result obtained in Step 3.
Subtracted 12 (one more time) = 26 - 12 = 14

Final Answer:
The final number after subtracting 12 three times is 14.",3.891,3,

**Problem:**
Start with the number 50. Subtract 12 three times. What number do you get?

---

**Solution:**

1. **Starting Number:**  
   Begin with the number 50.

   \[
   50
   \]

2. **First Subtraction:**  
   Subtract 12 from 50.

   \[
   50 - 12 = 38
   \]

3. **Second Subtraction:**  
   Subtract another 12 from the result.

   \[
   38 - 12 = 26
   \]

4. **Third Subtraction:**  
   Subtract one more 12 from the previous result.

1. The text states that the conference was scheduled to begin at 9 a.m., but it actually began at 10 a.m.
2. This indicates an unexpected delay of one hour.
3. The reason for this delay is mentioned: ""due to technical issues.""
4. Therefore, the primary cause of the conference starting later than planned was due to technical problems.
