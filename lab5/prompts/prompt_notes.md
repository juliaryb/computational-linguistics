## Ethical Reasoning

- Initial prompt:
    - "Analyze the following ethical scenario."
    - Analyze the following ethical scenario. Identify the main ethical issues, discuss relevant principles, and provide a balanced response and/or solution to the problem. Keep the answer concise (4–6 sentences)

- Issue:
Outputs were already acceptable for the initial prompt, however I wanted to check if providing more details on requirements would improve them. When asked for 6 sentences deepseek did make the output way more concise, but at the cost of understandability to a non-expert. Therefore, the final prompt doesn't contain the sentence limit, but asks for conciseness and no oversimplification. The smaller model doesn't make the output much shorter.

- Final prompt:
"Analyze the following ethical scenario. Identify the main ethical issues, discuss relevant principles, and provide a balanced response and/or solution to the problem. Keep the answer concise but not reduced - do not assume that the reader knows formal principles of ethics."


## Code generation
- Initial: "Generate correct and readable Python code to solve the following problem."
- Problem: Provided long explanations, deepseek still returned explanations after refining the prompt.
- Final: "Generate correct and readable Python code to solve the following problem, provide just the code in your output:"

## Common sense reasoning
- Initial: "Answer the question using everyday common-sense reasoning of a responsible human."
- Final: "Answer the question using everyday common-sense reasoning of a responsible human (Answer the question using everyday common-sense reasoning of a responsible human (most probably not long and using common everyday knowledge):"
