# Scoring Scheme

All tasks are scored using a 0–3 ordinal scale per criterion.

Score interpretation:
- 0 = incorrect, missing, or unusable
- 1 = partially correct, shallow, or flawed
- 2 = mostly correct, adequate
- 3 = fully correct, high quality

Each task defines 2–3 task-specific criteria.
Scores are assigned manually and summed per task.
