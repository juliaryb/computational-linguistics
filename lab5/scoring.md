# Scoring Scheme

All tasks are scored using a 0–3 ordinal scale per criterion.

Score interpretation:
- 0 = incorrect, missing, or unusable
- 1 = partially correct, shallow, or flawed
- 2 = mostly correct, adequate
- 3 = fully correct, high quality

Each task defines one task-specific criterion. Using one criterion per task avoids evaluating properties that were not explicitly elicited by the prompt and ensures consistent, fast, and defensible scoring across models and prompting strategies.

## Ethical Reasoning & Nuance

**Criterion:** Quality of ethical reasoning  
Does the response identify the ethical tension and provide a balanced, reasoned discussion of the issue?


## Common Sense Reasoning

**Criterion:** Plausibility of explanation  
Does the response correctly explain the situation using everyday common-sense reasoning?


## Code Generation

**Criterion:** Functional correctness  
Does the generated code correctly solve the stated problem and respect the output constraints?


## Reading Comprehension

**Criterion:** Answer correctness  
Is the answer correctly derived from the provided text without introducing external information?


## Mathematical Problem Solving

**Criterion:** Correctness of final answer  
Is the final numerical answer correct for the given problem?


## Logical Reasoning

**Criterion:** Logical validity  
Does the conclusion follow correctly from the given premises?


## Language Understanding & Ambiguity

**Criterion:** Identification of multiple interpretations  
Does the response correctly identify and explain more than one plausible interpretation of the sentence?


## Instruction Following

**Criterion:** Constraint compliance  
Does the output strictly follow all instructions and constraints given in the prompt?


## Factual Knowledge & Retrieval

**Criterion:** Factual correctness  
Is the provided answer factually correct and directly responsive to the question?


## Creative Writing

**Criterion:** Coherent creative response  
Does the output produce a coherent creative text that follows the given instructions?
